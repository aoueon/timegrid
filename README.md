## Don't waste your time

I find it really useful to know that time is passing oh-so-quickly. Don't be the onee who consumes time on low-return stuff, superficial entertainment, things you don't actually want to do, etc. Be the one who flows through time living, not dying. 

This tool should help you with the awareness part of it.

*Still a work in progress.*

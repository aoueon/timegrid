# Timeleft
## Don't waste your time

I find it really useful to know that time is passing oh-so-quickly. Don't be the onee who consumes time on low-return stuff, superficial entertainment, things you don't actually want to do, etc. Be the one who flows through time living, not dying. 

This tool should help you with the awareness part of it.

### Features

- **Single View:** If you click on a time box, you can see it in single view. This changes the URL hash, which you can access directly to see the selected time box in [single view](https://aoueon.github.io/timeleft/#week). To exit the single view, simply click on the box again.
- **Time Specs:** The 3 lines of time specs for every time box shows the total of time units left with more precision than the progress bar. One is for quick time awareness, and the other for a more meticulous study of your position in time.
- **Color Coded Urgency:** The progress bars will range from a blue hue to a red one, to signify closeness to the end.
